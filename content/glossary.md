# #biohacking
With the term '#biohacking' I refer to the endavour of a better **understanding** and taking **control** of my #meatsack and my #mind. To achieve this, it takes a wholly different mindset and some practices I listed further below. An integral part of my understanding of biohacking is a n=1 researcher's view, taking tests and analyzing the results.

# #quantified_self / #qs
>quantified self refers both to the cultural phenomenon of self-tracking with technology and to a community of users and makers of self-tracking tools who share an interest in “self-knowledge through numbers.”[1] 
Quantified Self practices overlap with the practice of lifelogging and other trends that incorporate technology and data acquisition into daily life, often with the goal of improving physical, mental, and/or emotional performance. ([WP](/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self))

My very personal and indepth journey with [#quantifiedself](/tags/quantifiedself) began 2015 when I suffered a severe flare up of Crohn's disease. Managing pain, various bloodwork and health naturally includes having a second (and third) look on numbers.

The value is best explained with the following example: about one and a half week before I nearly died with sepsis, my heartrate rocketed and my HRV sank. I tracked my heartrate just because I was into running and explored my bodily reactions on different training regimes. Since this experience, monitoring my heart as kind of a early warning system is routine. Meanwhile my Oura Ring does the monitoring unobtrusively in the background.

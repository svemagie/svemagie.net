*not yet finished, work in progress! I'll update this file gradually and update the date accordingly*

Every January I try to review the year in terms of character upgrades and achievements, items and other things of interest. I [track a lot of data](/glossary/#quantified_self--qs) - and making sense of it is part of all the fun.

>"Know Thyself" was inscribed at the temple of Apollo at Delphi, held up as an ideal in Latin and Christian philosophy, and recycled by generations of advice mongers. Self-knowledge was obtained through introspection and reflection; that is, through words.
(Gary Wolf in a famous 2009 wired article: https://www.wired.com/2009/06/lbnp-knowthyself/)

## Quick Overview of 2020
- still battling Crohn's disease, with a lot of ups and downs. the "ups" are on the positive side of this otherwise nerve wrecking disease.
- because my 'special needs' on [#biohacking](/glossary) and [#lifelogging](/glossary) I got into [programming](/glossary) again. Haven't touch a line of code since the 2000's, and I have to say: python is nice and fun! At least a bit of fun like Perl in those days.
- and yeah, um.. all things Covid-19, you know

## Biohacking and Lifelogging

Over the years I've hacked myself with n=1 experiments, self-tracking and personal data analysis to change my life.
And I firmly believe that technology and personal data can help others, too.

I divide [#biohacking](/glossary.md) into six main categories[^1]:
1. [Nutrition](/post/pyr2020/#1-nutrition)
2. [Movement](/post/pyr2020/#2-movement)
3. [Recovery](/post/pyr2020/#3-recovery)
4. [Balance](/post/pyr2020/#4-balance)
5. [Focus](/post/pyr2020/#5-focus)
6. [Environment](/post/pyr2020/#6-environment)

### 1. Nutrition
There are only three general nutritional rules for Crohn's disease:
1. no processed food
2. (mostly) plant based low carb, high fat (LCHF)
3. need for many pre/probiotics and micro nutrients (some of them as supplements)

All the rest is highly depended on whether being in flare up or in remission.

#### 1.1 Bodyweight and composition
Bodyweight is a great proxy for various variables. For example I can correlate CDAI with my weight, and I can see how I felt, how active Crohn's was just by looking at my weight.

{{< figure src="/pyr/all-weight.png" caption="Weight over the years" >}}

#### 1.2 Supplements
The only Supplements I've taken on a regular daily basis in 2020 is VitaminD and Omega-3-rich fish oil.

#### 1.3 Output

{{< figure src="/pyr/pooping2020.png" caption="Average 'Output' per day" >}}


### 2. Movement
In 2020 and Covid-19 my shape and fitness is not great. I became aware of being "on the move" is heavily dependend on [4. Balance](/post/pyr2020/#4-balance), [5. Focus](/post/pyr2020/#5-focus) and [6. Environment](/post/pyr2020/#6-environment). See on that factors later on.

I regularly track my steps, sports and fitness via my AppleWatch. For serious endeavors I switch to either my Garmin-Watch, a GPS-Brick or even SPOT-Tracker, depending on expected battery-use.

For 2020, I did no serious sports, no long hikes, and only some brisk walks in the park. On the one hand because of still battling Crohn's, which [sucks a lot of energy](#spoonie), on the other hand because of Covid-19 and general pandemic times.

Movement-Data is a bit sparse for 2020, but this is what I got:

{{< figure src="/pyr/steps2020.png" caption="Average steps" >}}

- 1,241,754 steps
- 3,383 daily average
- 931 km distance covered
- 1572 flights climbed
- Most active on Saturdays
- Most active times were between 13-15:00
- Most active month was February

{{< figure src="/pyr/workout-minutes-2020.png" caption="Workout Minutes" >}}


### 3. Recovery
long term goals:
- sleep more consistently (bedtime!) and at least 8.5 hours
- take it slow and easy, take many breaks and some copious naps
- not only for resting the body, but for brain, emotions, mental, too!

#### 3.1 Sleep
Daily Sleep Average: 8.17 hours

{{< figure src="/pyr/sleep2020.png" caption="Sleep Hours" >}}

{{< figure src="/pyr/allsleephist.png" caption="Sleeping hours distribution" >}}

#### 3.2 Heart
Heart variables are excellent predictors and measures of general health. 
Goals are keeping the average heart rate low and HRV (Heart Rate Variability) high.

{{< figure src="/pyr/heart-resting-2020.png" caption="Resting Heart rate from Apple Watch" >}}
{{< figure src="/pyr/heart-oura-resting-2020.png" caption="Resting Heart rate from Oura Ring" >}}

 
### 4. Balance
Goal: Meditate at least 10 minutes a day; take care of recovery times, spend more time outdoors, have fun!

#### 4.1 Meditation
{{< figure src="/pyr/meditation2020.png" caption="Meditation" >}}


#### 4.2 Outdoor Time
Spending time outdoors was a huge thing in the past, but with ongoing Crohn's and Pandemics I felt like glued to the Couch. Nothing interesting there, though, except for a few strolls here and there. Most of the time it looked like that:
{{< figure src="/pyr/IMG_3084.jpg" caption="Outdoor Time" >}}
2021 will be more active, hopefully, as I'm newly recruited as ["Runner 5"](https://zombiesrungame.com).

### 5. Focus
Goal: don't waste mind power and brain time; cut down social networking and idle more willful.

#### 5.1 Where my (computer) time went
I track my time spent on computer with [Rescuetime](https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/2143149). I started to evaluate [ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net/) mostly because of my arm64 based [PinebookPro](/tags/pinebook).

{{< figure src="/pyr/rescuetime-hourly-2020.png" caption="Distribution of productiveness by hour" >}}

#### 5.2 What I've been reading
I've had a hard time reading, so this year was not even average in terms of 'books read'. All physical, ebooks and audiobooks where tracked with goodreads and/or Kindle, Articles from the web where read via instapaper.

#### Book Reading Summary
- 14 total books read
- 1873 total number of pages read
- 312 average number of pages per book
{{< figure src="/pyr/booksreadpermonth2020.png" caption="Books read by Month" >}}

Kindle Highlights Summary
- 663 total book highlights
- 20 total Books highlighted
- 33.2 average number of highlights per book
- 82.9 monthly average
- 309 most in a month
- 11 least in a month

#### Wordcloud of what I highlighted on the Web
{{< figure src="/pyr/articles_2020_highlights_wordcloud.png" caption="Highlights wordcloud of read articles" >}}


#### 5.3 GTD

#### 5.4 Inbox Zero

#### 5.5 Social Media usage

### 6. Environment
Goals:
- declutter: my living room is my office, my fridge is usually overloaded which results in waste of energy and food
- fine-tune smarthome appliances: I was able to cut down energy consumption regardless of 2 new devices (a small Bass Amp and a used PS4)
- make progress turning into a more ecological lifestyle and resources consumption: I was able to cut down on plastics use, switched toiletry to less packaging, using 

#### 6.1 Handwashing
Apple introduced "Handwashing" on the Apple Watch in 2020 because of Covid-19, so here's my data.

#### 6.2 Smarthome

#### 6.3 Music, Listening and Playing
Started to play the Bass again. After something around 20 years I wonder how I lived for so long without it! After the pandemics I'll hopefully ramped up my finger-fitness again an I'm eager to play in a band. Those rare moments in life when completely tuned-in with other people...! 

## Working and Writing
Work-wise it was a very calm year, thankfully, because with Crohn's flaring up and down I never could have worked a full 8h day, every day. Instead I focused on healing, on mind and body. I spent a good time on playing the bass again. I even got a nudge to keep up with developments in #FreeBSD again, which I completely abadoned about 2003 when I got my first MacBook. Before that, I worked almost exclusivly on \*BSDs and Solaris, both professionally and at home. With the beginning of my studies in sociology and politics, I stepped away from being an UNIX BOFH and Consultant to just using computers as tools for research, some scholastic number crunching, as teaching and presentation devices and a bit of distration devices.

In the beginning of the pandemics (starting around mid-April 2020) I wrote a lot in a quite autoethnographic style and focus. I just sensed this thing is huge. Huge not only knowledge-wise but also as an sociologically incisive aera. I read and wrote to simply get a grip on the everchanging things that happened - while nothing happend around me personally. All that went into my #Zettelkasten, along with other evidences like photos of the signs the shopkeepers hang because of the #Lockdown. This is a huge pool of yet mostly unstructured information that I can query and ask questions to everytime I want.

Those examples of Lockdown signs are a good resource for interpretation and are quite telling, not only about the subjective meanings that went into the signs and pouring out of it. They are, different as they are, quite telling me (us) something about the particular time and society in which they are meant to tell the bypassers something.

I find the best and vivid expression on this is following wordcloud from the titles of articles I read in 2020-03:

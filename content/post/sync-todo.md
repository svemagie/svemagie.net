Each of my legs stand firmly in one eco-system: most of my work is done on an Apple Powerhorse, but there's other beautiful Unixes, too. Some other things and most of digital leisure happens on a Linux Laptop, the [PineBook Pro](https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/). So bringing those worlds play along nicely is a task. This time: GTD (Getting things done): managing business and private tasks.

I work in Unix terminals most of the time, so my nifty taskmanager for the console is console-based [taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/). On OSX and iOS I moved from Omnifocus to Todoist, back and forth. I bet those switches are more or less project-bound: heavy duty task- and projectmanagement is done on Omnifocus, everyday managing is on Todoist.

I recently found a nice script which does the syncing of those two systems: https://github.com/StefanBRas/todoist-taskwarrior (which is a fork of https://github.com/matt-snider/todoist-taskwarrior).

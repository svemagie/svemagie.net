Every January I try to review the year in terms of character upgrades and achievements, items and other things of interest. I [track a lot of data](/glossary/#quantified_self--qs) - and making sense of it is part of all the fun.

>"Know Thyself" was inscribed at the temple of Apollo at Delphi, held up as an ideal in Latin and Christian philosophy, and recycled by generations of advice mongers. Self-knowledge was obtained through introspection and reflection; that is, through words.
(Gary Wolf in a famous 2009 wired article: https://www.wired.com/2009/06/lbnp-knowthyself/)

## Quick Overview of 2020
- still battling Crohn's disease, with a lot of ups and downs. the "ups" are on the positive side of this otherwise nerve wrecking disease.
- because my 'special needs' on [#biohacking](/glossary.md) and [#lifelogging](/glossary.md) I got into [programming](/glossary.md) again. Haven't touch a line of code since the 2000's, and I have to say: python is nice and fun! At least a bit of fun like Perl in those days.
- and yeah, um.. all things Covid-19, you know

## Biohacking and Lifelogging

Over the years I've hacked myself with n=1 experiments, self-tracking and personal data analysis to change my life.
And I firmly believe that technology and personal data can help others, too.

I divide [#biohacking](/glossary.md) into six main categories[^1]:
1. [Nutrition](/pyr/pyr2020/#1-nutrition)
2. [Movement](/pyr/pyr2020/#2-movement)
3. [Recovery](/pyr/pyr2020/#3-recovery)
4. [Balance](/pyr/pyr2020/#4-balance)
5. [Focus](/pyr/pyr2020/#5-focus)
6. [Environment](/pyr/pyr2020/#6-environment)

### 1. Nutrition
There are only three general nutritional rules for Crohn's disease:
1. no processed food
2. (mostly) plant based low carb, high fat (LCHF)
3. need for many pre/probiotics and micro nutrients (some of them as supplements)

All the rest is highly depended on whether being in flare up or in remission.

#### 1.1 Bodyweight and composition
Bodyweight is a great proxy for various variables. For example I can correlate CDAI with my weight, and I can see how I felt, how active Crohn's was just by looking at my weight.

#### 1.2 Supplements
The only Supplements I've taken on a regular daily basis in 2020 is VitaminD and Omega-3-rich fish oil.

#### 1.3 Output

{{< figure src="/pyr/pooping2020.png" caption="Average 'Output' per day" >}}


### 2. Movement
In 2020 and Covid-19 my shape and fitness is not great. I became aware of being "on the move" is heavily dependend on [4. Balance](/pyr/pyr2020/#4-balance), [5. Focus](/pyr/pyr2020/#5-focus) and [6. Environment](/pyr/pyr2020/#6-environment). See on that factors later on.

I regularly track my steps, sports and fitness via my AppleWatch. For serious endeavors I switch to either my Garmin-Watch, a GPS-Brick or even SPOT-Tracker, depending on expected battery-use.

For 2020, I did no serious sports, no long hikes, and only some brisk walks in the park. On the one hand because of still battling Crohn's, which [sucks a lot of energy](#spoonie), on the other hand because of Covid-19 and general pandemic times.

Movement-Data is a bit sparse for 2020, but this is what I got:

{{< figure src="/pyr/steps2020.png" caption="Average steps" >}}

- 1,241,754 steps
- 3,383 daily average
- 931 km distance covered
- 1572 flights climbed
- Most active on Saturdays
- Most active times were between 13-15:00
- Most active month was February

### 3. Recovery
long term goals:
- sleep more consistently (bedtime!) and at least 8.5 hours
- take it slow and easy, take many breaks and some copious naps
- not only for resting the body, but for brain, emotions, mental, too!

#### 3.1 Sleep
Daily Sleep Average: 8.17 hours

{{< figure src="/pyr/sleep2020.png" caption="Sleep Hours" >}}

#### 3.2 Heart
Heart variables are excellent predictors and measures of general health. 
Goals are keeping the average heart rate low and HRV (Heart Rate Variability) high.

{{< figure src="/pyr/heart-oura-resting-2020.png" caption="Resting Heart rate from Oura Ring" >}}


 
### 4. Balance
Goal: Meditate at least 10 minutes a day; take care of recovery times, spend more time outdoors, have fun!

#### 4.1 Meditation
{{< figure src="/pyr/meditation2020.png" caption="Meditation" >}}


#### 4.2 Outdoor Time

### 5. Focus
Goal: don't waste mind power and brain time; cut down social networking and idle more willful.

#### 5.1 Where my (computer) time went
I track my time spent on computer with [Rescuetime](https://www.rescuetime.com). I started to evaluate [ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net/) mostly because of my arm64 based [PinebookPro](/tags/pinebook).

{{< figure src="/pyr/rescuetime-hourly-2020.png" caption="Distribution of productiveness by hour" >}}

#### 5.2 What I've been reading
I've had a hard time reading, so this year was not even average in terms of 'books read'. All physical, ebooks and audiobooks where tracked with goodreads and/or Kindle, Articles from the web where read via instapaper.

#### Book Reading Summary
- 14 total books read
- 1873 total number of pages read
- 312 average number of pages per book
{{< figure src="/pyr/booksreadpermonth2020.png" caption="Books read by Month" >}}

Kindle Highlights Summary
- 663 total book highlights
- 20 total Books highlighted
- 33.2 average number of highlights per book
- 82.9 monthly average
- 309 most in a month
- 11 least in a month

#### Wordcloud of what I highlighted on the Web
{{< figure src="/pyr/articles_2020_highlights_wordcloud.png" caption="Highlights wordcloud of read articles" >}}


#### 5.3 GTD
#### 5.4 Inbox Zero
#### 5.5 Social Media usage

### 6. Environment
Goals:
- declutter: my living room is my office, my fridge is usually overloaded which results in waste of energy and food
- fine-tune smarthome appliances: I was able to cut down energy consumption regardless of 2 new devices (a small Bass Amp and a used PS4)
- make progress turning into a more ecological lifestyle and resources consumption: I was able to cut down on plastics use, switched toiletry to less packaging, using 

#### 6.1 Handwashing
Apple introduced "Handwashing" on the Apple Watch in 2020 because of Covid-19, so here's my data:
#### 6.2 Smarthome

#### 6.3 Music, Listening and Playing
